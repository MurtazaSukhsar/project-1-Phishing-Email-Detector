# 📧 Phishing Email Detector 🚨  

A Python-based tool to analyze email text files and detect potential phishing attempts.  
This project was developed with the assistance of **AI (ChatGPT)** to speed up coding, improve detection logic, and design a professional CLI interface.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Detects suspicious **keywords** (urgent, verify, account, etc.)
- Identifies **URLs** and flags shortened links (bit.ly, tinyurl, etc.)
- Saves results into a `report.txt`
- **Beautiful CLI output** with colors and banners
- Example phishing and safe emails included

## 🤖 About AI Assistance
This project was built with the help of **AI (ChatGPT)**, which assisted in:
- Code generation & debugging  
- Improving CLI design with colors & banners  
- Documentation & structuring for GitHub  

Using AI boosted productivity and allowed me to focus more on **cybersecurity concepts** rather than just syntax.
